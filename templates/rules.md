# Rules
## _May the odds be ever in your favor_


### How it works
Each player will be given a target. Your objective is to stab your target with a spoon (we can’t use anything sharper than that or it is considered assault). You must stab your target on the front of their torso for it to count. Once you have eliminated your target that person’s target becomes your next target. If you do not eliminate your original target before the round is complete you will be eliminated. When you kill your target you will submit a kill report on your profile, when the victim approves the kill report you will automatically be assigned your next target. There will be multiple rounds with decreasing amounts of time. The first round begins this Friday, April 12th at 12:00 a.m. and will end on Tuesday, April 16th at 12:00 p.m.. 

### Rules

      * While rule 1 is the _lex communis_ of this document the Bureau of Bloodshed reserves the right to disqualify any player for abuse of this rule
7. If your assassin stabs you but you successfully defend yourself (meaning you stab them in their torso before they stab you in their torso):
    * Your assassin cannot attempt to kill you again for 12 hours

8. You must have a clear picture of yourself uploaded to this website to participate. (Clearly identifiable, no other people in the image, face fully shown, basic ID card rules ect...)
